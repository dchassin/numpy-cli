[[//I0]]
Syntax:

  numpy I0 [<function array at 0x105a76b00>]


    Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0.

    Usually denoted :math:`I_0`.  This function does broadcast, but will *not*
    "up-cast" int dtype arguments unless accompanied by at least one float or
    complex dtype argument (see Raises below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, dtype float or complex
        Argument of the Bessel function.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, shape = x.shape, dtype = x.dtype
        The modified Bessel function evaluated at each of the elements of `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError: array cannot be safely cast to required type
        If argument consists exclusively of int dtypes.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.special.i0, scipy.special.iv, scipy.special.ive

    Notes
    -----
    The scipy implementation is recommended over this function: it is a
    proper ufunc written in C, and more than an order of magnitude faster.

    We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw [1]_ and referenced by
    Abramowitz and Stegun [2]_, for which the function domain is
    partitioned into the two intervals [0,8] and (8,inf), and Chebyshev
    polynomial expansions are employed in each interval. Relative error on
    the domain [0,30] using IEEE arithmetic is documented [3]_ as having a
    peak of 5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000).
