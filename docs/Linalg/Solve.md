numpy solve <matrix> <matrix>


    Solve a linear matrix equation, or system of linear scalar equations.

    Computes the "exact" solution, `x`, of the well-determined, i.e., full
    rank, linear matrix equation `ax = b`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Coefficient matrix.
    b : {(..., M,), (..., M, K)}, array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values.

    Returns
    -------
    x : {(..., M,), (..., M, K)} ndarray
        Solution to the system a x = b.  Returned shape is identical to `b`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `a` is singular or not square.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    The solutions are computed using LAPACK routine ``_gesv``.

    `a` must be square and of full-rank, i.e., all rows (or, equivalently,
    columns) must be linearly independent; if either is not true, use
    `lstsq` for the least-squares best "solution" of the
    system/equation.

    Examples
    --------
    Solve the system of equations ``3 * x0 + x1 = 9`` and ``x0 + 2 * x1 = 8``:

    >>> a = np.array([[3,1], [1,2]])
    >>> b = np.array([9,8])
    >>> x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)
    >>> x
    array([2.,  3.])

    Check that the solution is correct:

    >>> np.allclose(np.dot(a, x), b)
    True
