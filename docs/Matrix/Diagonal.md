[[/Matrix/Diagonal]]
Syntax:

  numpy Diagonal [<function matrix at 0x100b237a0>]

a.diagonal(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1)

    Return specified diagonals. In NumPy 1.9 the returned array is a
    read-only view instead of a copy as in previous NumPy versions.  In
    a future version the read-only restriction will be removed.

    Refer to :func:`numpy.diagonal` for full documentation.
